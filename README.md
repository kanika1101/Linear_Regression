# Multiple Linear Regression to Predict factors affecting Price of a car

A Chinese automobile company wants to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. 

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
- How well those variables describe the price of a car

A consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the Americal market. 

#### Business Goal 

You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. 

## Solution Overview to perform a Multiple Linear Regression Model

#### Step 1: Reading, Understanding and cleaning the Data
- 1.1 Reading and understanding
- 1.2 Cleaning data

#### Step 2: EDA and Visualizing the data
- 2.1 Visualizing categorical variables
- 2.2 Visualizing numerical variables

#### Step 3. Data Preparation
- 3.1 Adding Derived variables
- 3.2 Creating dummy variables

#### Step 4. Creating Training and Testing Sets and scaling the features
- 4.1 Dividing the data into train and test set
- 4.2 Scaling numeric variables

#### Step 5. Building the linear model
- 5.1 Using RFE to select initial 10 features
- 5.2 Building linear model using statsmodel
- 5.3 Dropping columns and re-evaluating the model

#### Step 6. Residual Analysis of train data 

#### Step 7. Predictions on the Test Set

#### Step 8. Model Evaluation and Inference
